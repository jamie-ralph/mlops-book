# Preface {.unnumbered}

MLOps is a big field. I work in MLOps and spend a lot of time learning things. Unfortunately my brain can only store so much information, and it's easy to forget stuff. 

This book is a repository of the knowledge I've learned since starting in MLOps. The content can roughly be divided into these categories:

* Short summaries of topics with links to articles that explain things nicely
* Notes I've taken from video courses (I find these the most time consuming and attention hungry. Taking notes mean I only sit through them once)
* Useful hints from technical books I've read
