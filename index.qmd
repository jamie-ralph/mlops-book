# Preface {.unnumbered}

Machine learning operations (MLOps) is a set of practices that applies DevOps principles to the ML model lifecycle. MLOps teams manage a complex ecosystem of tools and platforms that data scientists and ML engineers use to productionise their models. I started working in MLOps in February 2024 and quickly found it a steep learning curve. One of the challenges was just knowing where to start and where to look for information. This book tries to bring together the resources I've found most useful for working in MLOps. 

This book is a work in progress. The planned sections for the book fall roughly into these categories:

* Kubernetes
* Linux
* Python
* Essental non-technical skills (e.g. time management)
