# Big Book of MLOPs

Welcome! The purpose of this book is to be a repository for online resources (plus some of my own notes) about MLOps/DevOps. You can find the GitHub pages site [here](https://jamie-ralph.github.io/mlops-book/). The book is built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org) and GitHub actions.
