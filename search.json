Unfortunately my brain can only store so much information, and it’s easy to forget stuff.\nThis book is a repository of the knowledge I’ve learned since starting in MLOps. The content can roughly be divided into these categories:\n\nShort summaries of topics with links to articles that explain things nicely\nNotes I’ve taken from video courses (I find these the most time consuming and attention hungry. Taking notes mean I only sit through them once)\nUseful hints from technical books I’ve read",

The author covers key concepts like network namespaces, interfaces, network switches, and container network interfaces (CNI).\nThis video on Kubernetes ingress by TechWorld with Nana gives a really nice overview of how Kubernetes services are exposed securely to the outside world. The video includes details on routing, ingress controllers, enabling HTTPS, and how ingress looks different in cloud platforms vs bare metal.",
