    "text": "Preface\nMachine learning operations (MLOps) is a set of practices that applies DevOps principles to the ML model lifecycle. MLOps teams manage a complex ecosystem of tools and platforms that data scientists and ML engineers use to productionise their models. I started working in MLOps in February 2024 and quickly found it a steep learning curve. One of the challenges was just knowing where to start and where to look for information. This book tries to bring together the resources I’ve found most useful for working in MLOps.\nThis book is a work in progress. The planned sections for the book fall roughly into these categories:\n\nKubernetes\nLinux\nPython\nEssental non-technical skills (e.g. time management)",

The author covers key concepts like network namespaces, interfaces, network switches, and container network interfaces (CNI).\nThis video on Kubernetes ingress by TechWorld with Nana gives a really nice overview of how Kubernetes services are exposed securely to the outside world. The video includes details on routing, ingress controllers, enabling HTTPS, and how ingress looks different in cloud platforms vs bare metal.",
