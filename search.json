    "text": "Preface\nMachine learning operations (MLOps) is a set of practices that applies DevOps principles to the ML model lifecycle. MLOps teams manage a complex ecosystem of tools and platforms that data scientists and ML engineers use to productionise their models. I started working in MLOps in February 2024 and quickly found it a steep learning curve. One of the challenges was just knowing where to start and where to look for information. This book tries to bring together the resources I’ve found most useful for working in MLOps.\nThis book is a work in progress. The planned sections for the book fall roughly into these categories:\n\nKubernetes\nLinux\nPython\nEssental non-technical skills (e.g. time management)",

    "text": "Services, Load Balancing, Networking from the official Kubernetes docs gives a nice overview of Kubernetes networking APIs and requirements.\n\nThe official docs on Services goes into more detail on how services enable reliable communication with groups of pods whose IP addresses change as they’re destroyed and recreated.\nThis article on different service types by KodeKloud goes into detail about the different service types available in Kubernetes.\nTracing the path of network traffic in Kubernetes by Kristijan Mitevski goes into much more detail about the mechanisms underlying pod to pod communication. The author covers key concepts like network namespaces, interfaces, network switches, and container network interfaces (CNI).\nThe official docs on EndpointSlices shows how Kubernetes bridges the gap between services and pods.\nThis video on Kubernetes ingress by TechWorld with Nana gives a really nice overview of how Kubernetes services are exposed securely to the outside world. The video includes details on routing, ingress controllers, enabling HTTPS, and how ingress looks different in cloud platforms vs bare metal.\nKubernetes uses DNS to allow workloads to find services using consistent domain names instead of IP address. Tech Tutorials with Piyush introduces this topic with a hands-on demo. The official docs also talk about how DNS works in Kubernetes and provides a comprehensive guide to debugging DNS.",
